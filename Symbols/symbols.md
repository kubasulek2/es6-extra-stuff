# Symbols

* it is a primitive type
* it's unique identifier (it's not guaranteed, but probability of not unique symbol is symbolic only )
* can't get identifier itself, only "Symbol" is displayed.
* used mainly for unique object keys. (When want to prevent overriding important properties.)
* symbols aren't iterable, so wont be displayed in eg. for in loop
* Well-known symbols are properties and methods internally used by javascript engine.
