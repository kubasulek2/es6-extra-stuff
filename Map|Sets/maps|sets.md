# Maps:

* are collections of key value pairs. keys are unique.
* under the hood are arrays of nested two elements(key and value) arrays.
* maps can have any type of keys, so object, array can be the key by contrast to objects, that can only have strings, numbers and symbols as keys.
* maps have different interface than object
* you can iterate them with for of loop with map.keys(), map.values() or map.entries() as iterable
* maps unlike objects preserve keys order.

# WeakMap

* weakMaps keys must be objects!!
* because of that(objects are referenced types) properties of weakMaps can be automatically garbage collected if not used any more.
